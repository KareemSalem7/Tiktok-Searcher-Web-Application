# Tiktok-Searcher-Web-Application
Web application created using pywebio that searches through liked videos of a specified user with public liked given a certain keyword. 
This program essentially takes from a previous project https://github.com/PedroContipelli/LikedVideosSearchForTikTok, makes it into a web application, updates
it using a proxy ID, and is modified for TikTokApi 5.1.1.
